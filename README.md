Practicing HTML/CSS/Javascript coding some games
This is a small code based on the classic game Pong (AtariÂ®).
It looks simple, but it was quite a challenge for a beginner like me.
With this code, I could practice/study things such as object movement on mouseover, rebound movement of an object when a specific X or Y position is defined, changing the speed of objects when some criteria are met, adding audio files, etc.
I hope this code is useful to someone.
